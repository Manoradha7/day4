1. How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?

	* Two objects can be compared by converting them to string and comparing those strings. However, when the properties of the 2 objects are the same but are not in the same order,
  the converted strings when compared will not return true even when they should.
	
  * Therefore, the way to compare two objects which have the same properties but in different orders is to compare each value individually.
  
  
  
  var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

 var flag=true;

if(Object.keys(obj1).length==Object.keys(obj2).length){
    for(key in obj1) { 
        if(obj1[key] == obj2[key]) {
            continue;
        }
        else {
            flag=false;
            break;
        }
    }
}
else {
    flag=false;
}
console.log("is object equal"+" "+flag);
